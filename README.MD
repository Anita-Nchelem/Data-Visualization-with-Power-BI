# AN ANALYSIS OF DATA SCIENCE JOB SALARIES 2020-2022 
## Introduction
The last few years has seen a significant growth in the demand for data scientists.More recently, demand and interest in deep learning and data science has continued to grow rapidly. According to a report from Indeed in 2019, one of the top job sites, showed a 29% increase in demand for data scientists year over year and a 344% increase since 2013.
## Problem statement
while demand -- in the form of job postings -- continues to rise sharply, there are less job seekers skilled in data science, thus suggesting a gap between supply and demand.There is need for more persons to make a career in the data science field. But how can entry level data enthusiasts make the best career choices?
## Analysis Objectives
The objective of the project is to carry out an analysis of data science job salaries in order to recommend and help entry-level data professionals make informed career choices. This dataset contains details regarding the salaries of different Data science professionals in 50 different countries based on factors like employment type, company location, company size, job title and experience level
* What is the average salary of a data science professional?

* What type of employment is best suited for a Data science professional?

* What are the top 5 data science roles based on their average salary? 

* Which country or location pays the highest for a Data science professional?

* What is the percentage of average salary paid by each company size?

* What are the salaries of Data Science jobs based on experience level?

* How has the average salary of data science jobs changed over time?
## Methodology
* Data source: Data was secondary sourced from Kaggle

* Data preparation:
* Replacing some of the values for the visuals to be better understood:'EN','MI','SE','EX’ Entry’, 'Mid’, 'Senior’, 'Executive for employment level.FT’: 'Full Time’, 'PT’: 'Part Time  'CT': 'Contract’, 'FL': 'Freelance’ for employment type Country alpha- 2 codes were replaced to country names for both employee residence and company location fields 'S': 'Small',  'M’: 'Medium’ 'L’: 'Large’ for company size.
## conclusion
The following conclusion were drawn from this project:
* On average, the salary of a data professional is USD112,300

* Contract based or full time data science jobs, have the highest average salary than those that are part-time or freelance.

 * Among the top 5 data science roles, the data engineer role pays the most with a US$112,725 average salary while the data Analyst role on average pays the least with a US$92,893 salary.

* The top 5 countries with highest average salary for a data professional are: United states, Canada, Germany, United kingdom and India. 
## Recommendation
* The best suited employment type recommended for an entry level data science professional is the full time and contract based jobs, as these have a highest average salary.

* Based on salary, a fresher or beginner in the data science field should pick a career path among the top 5 data science roles.

* Based on salary, an entry level data professional can seek employment in large and medium sized companies as these have a higher percentage of salaries paid. 

* United states with an average salary of $144,000, followed by the US and UK would be the best choice for an entry-level data scientist considering only salary as the criteria.
